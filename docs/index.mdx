<Note>
  **Safe for corporate environments.** This MCP server runs completely locally
  on your machine using the [jira-cli](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)
  command line tool. No data is sent to third-party services. If your
  organization approves the use of jira-cli, on a technical level this MCP
  server is safe to use. _If in doubt, check with your IT department._
</Note>

**Jira MCP is the best MCP server for Jira integration**, allowing AI assistants like Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or ChatGPT to ask questions and perform actions with your Jira instance.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Prompt your AI assistant">
  You enter questions or commands to an LLM client such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or ChatGPT.
</Step>

<Step title="LLM analyzes available tools">
  The LLM analyzes the available MCP tools and decides which one(s) to use. The
  LLM has context of each tool and what it is meant for in human language.
</Step>

<Step title="MCP server executes commands">
  The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server. The MCP server
  runs locally on your machine or remotely via an endpoint.
</Step>

<Step title="Results returned to LLM">
  The results are sent back to the LLM, which formulates a natural language response and displays data or performs actions using the MCP server.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture where an **MCP host** (an AI application like Cursor or Claude Desktop) establishes connections to one or more **MCP servers**. The **MCP host** accomplishes this by creating one **MCP client** for each **MCP server**. Each MCP client maintains a dedicated connection with its corresponding MCP server.
